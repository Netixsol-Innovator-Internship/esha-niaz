# Next.js + RTK Query + Tailwind (JSX)

Tailwind config is included. Install dependencies then run:
1. npm install
2. npm run dev

Important:
- app/layout.jsx imports app/globals.css (where Tailwind is declared).
- If Tailwind still doesn't apply, ensure you installed dependencies and restarted the dev server.
